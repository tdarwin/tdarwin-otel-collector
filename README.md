# tdarwin-otel-collector

This repo is an example for building your own custom collector container image with your chosen components.  It's not intended for any production environments or workloads,and is not supported by anyone, myself included.

## If you have issues

If you're using this, and you have issues, you could submit a PR, and I might see it eventually, but I won't respond to repo issues as I don't care.  Again, this is not a supported collector build.
